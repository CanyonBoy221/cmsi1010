# Lab 13: Mondrian Art Generator

Creating Piet Mondrian-style abstract art using pygame.

This lab generates random compositions inspired by the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian, featuring colored rectangles arranged in a grid pattern. The program uses pygame to create interactive graphics with randomly placed rectangles in Mondrian's characteristic style.
