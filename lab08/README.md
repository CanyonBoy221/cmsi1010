# Lab 08: Recursion Experiments

Initial experiments with recursion in Python.

## What it does
The `im_so_sorry.py` program demonstrates both recursive and iterative approaches:

1. `blocks(n)` - A recursive function that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n (triangular numbers)
2. `factorial(n)` - An iterative function that calculates the factorial of n
3. `print_count_down(n)` - A recursive function that prints a countdown from n to 1, then prints "BOOM"

The program calculates the factorial of 6 (720) and then counts down from that number, demonstrating:
- Base cases and recursive cases in functions
- The difference between recursive and iterative implementations
- How recursion builds up a call stack
- Practical applications of recursion for counting and mathematical operations
