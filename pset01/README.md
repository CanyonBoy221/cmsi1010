# Problem Set 01

This assignment includes:
- A number guessing game where a random number is generated and the user must guess it
- Functions that perform specific operations based on input parameters
- Functions cardio exercises to practice writing and using functions

## Programs

### number_guesser.py
An interactive number guessing game where:
- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 1000
- Players guess the number and receive feedback (higher/lower)
- Tracks the number of guesses taken
- Generates a new number after each correct guess
- Supports 'exit' and 'bye' commands to quit
- Validates input to ensure only numbers are accepted

### functions_cardio.py
A set of function exercises to practice fundamental programming concepts:
- `print_square(n)` - Prints an n×n square of asterisks
- `is_odd(n)` - Returns True if a number is odd
- Various other functions for mathematical operations, string manipulation, and logic
- Includes unit tests at the bottom to verify each function works correctly
