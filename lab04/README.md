# Lab 04: Petting Zoo

An interactive program for using the input function and some string functions.

## What it does
The `zoo.py` program creates an interactive petting zoo experience where users can:
- View a list of available animals (Clover the Bunny, Coco the Baby Goat, and Arno the Alligator)
- Pet individual animals by name (with different responses for each)
- Get help with available commands
- Exit the program gracefully

The program demonstrates:
- Using `input()` to get user commands
- String manipulation with `.strip()` and `.lower()` for case-insensitive input
- Conditional logic with `if/elif/else` statements
- While loops for continuous interaction
- String methods like `.startswith()` for parsing commands
