# Problem Set 02

This assignment includes:
- Mad Libs program that generates random stories from templates
- Data structures cardio exercises to practice working with lists, dictionaries, and other data structures

## Programs

### mad_libs.py
A Mad Libs-style story generator that:
- Defines multiple story templates with placeholders for different word types
- Contains word banks for various categories (adjectives, nouns, animals, places, foods, etc.)
- Randomly selects a template and fills in the blanks with random words
- Can include author attribution for each template
- Demonstrates working with nested dictionaries and random selection

### data_structures_cardio.py
Practice exercises for mastering Python data structures:
- Functions that manipulate lists (sorting, filtering, transforming)
- Dictionary operations (merging, lookup, key/value manipulation)
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)
- Nested data structure traversal
- List comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions
- Includes unit tests to verify correctness
