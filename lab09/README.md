# Lab 09: Towers of Hanoi

A classic recursive algorithm implementation that solves the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.

This lab demonstrates recursion by moving disks between three pegs according to the rules of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The program accepts a command-line argument specifying the number of disks and outputs each move required to solve the puzzle.
