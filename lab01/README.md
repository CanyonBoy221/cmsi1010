# Lab 01: Triangle Art

Programs to draw triangles with the Python `print` function.

## What it does
The `triangle.py` program defines a `print_triangle` function that creates ASCII art triangles by printing progressively longer lines of a specified character. The program demonstrates:
- Using a function with parameters (character and number of lines)
- Looping with `range()` to create patterns
- String multiplication to repeat characters
- Multiple function calls with different arguments to create various triangle sizes and characters
