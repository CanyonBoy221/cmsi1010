# Lab 12: Fractal Tree

Drawing fractal trees using recursive algorithms and graphics.

This lab explores recursive graphics by generating beautiful fractal tree patterns. The program uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) to create tree structures that branch and grow based on recursive patterns, with customizable colors, angles, and growth parameters.
